        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>Born and raised in Scarborough, Ontario I devoloped a interest in technology in my early years, whether it was through playing games on my moms phone to fiddling around with a raspberry pi. Upon attending Queen's University, I took an introductory python class and from there I knew I found another passion of mine.</p>
        <p>A solid background in computer science and great problem solving ability has igntied an aspiration to get into web development where I can help people turn their ideas to reality on the digital plane. To broadcast these ideas I took up digital marketing which is another interest of mine.</p>
